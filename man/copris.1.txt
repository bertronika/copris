NAME
       copris - a converting printer server

SYNOPSIS
       copris [options] [printer or output file]
       copris --dump-commands > new_printer_set.ini

DESCRIPTION
       COPRIS  is  a printer server and text conversion program, intended to receive UTF-8
       encoded text locally or over a network, process it and  send  it  to  a  dot-matrix
       printer.   In  its  core,  COPRIS  reads text from standard input or a built-in TCP
       socket server (similar to telnet(1) or nc(1)), and optionally applies two  process-
       ing methods to it:

   Character translation
       COPRIS  can load a translation file that defines user-specified characters, not un-
       derstood by printers - usually multi-byte (UTF-8) ones.  They are swapped with  ap-
       propriate  (or  at least similar) locale-specific replacements, defined in the same
       file.

   Printer feature sets
       While COPRIS processes only plain text, some additional markup can be applied to it
       via  printer  feature  set files.  These may specify printer’s escape codes for at-
       tributes, such as bold, italic, double-width text,  they  may  change  font  faces,
       sizes,  spacing  and  so  on.  COPRIS searches for a subset of Markdown attributes,
       present in input text, and replaces them with printer’s escape codes, much the same
       as with translation files.

   File format
       Translation  and  printer feature set files are expected to be in the INI file for-
       mat:

              # Comment
              [section]
              key = whitespace separated values ; inline comment

       In case you need a key to resolve to a blank value, set @ as the value (e.g. if you
       want to remove instead of replace certain characters in the text, or omit rendering
       some Markdown attributes).

OPTIONS
       -p, --port NUMBER
              Run COPRIS as a network server on port NUMBER.  Superuser privileges are re-
              quired if NUMBER is less than 1024.

       -t, --translate FILE
              Enable  character  translation  with  definitions from character translation
              FILE.

       -r, --printer FILE
              Enable Markdown parsing with definitions from printer feature set FILE.

       --dump-commands
              Show all possible printer feature set commands in INI file  format  (e.g. to
              be piped into a new printer feature set file you are making).

       -d, --daemon
              If running as a network server, do not exit after the first connection.

       -l, --limit NUMBER
              If running as a network server, limit number of received bytes to NUMBER.

       --cutoff-limit
              If limit is active, cut text on NUMBER count instead of discarding the whole
              chunk.

       -v, --verbose
              Show informative status messages.  If specified twice, show even  more  mes-
              sages.

       -q, --quiet
              Do  not  show  any  unneccessary messages, except warnings and fatal errors,
              routed to stderr.  This also omits notes, shown if COPRIS assumes it is  not
              invoked properly.

       -h, --help
              Show a short option summary.

       -V, --version
              Show program version, author and build-time options.

       Do  not  specify  a port number if you want to read from standard input.  Likewise,
       omit the output file to have text echoed out to standard  output  (or  piped  else-
       where).

EXAMPLES
       Run  as  a  simple server on port 8080, perform no text conversion, output received
       data to the serial port and exit after one connection.  Note that superuser  privi-
       leges are required if the specified port is smaller than 1024.

              copris -p 8080 /dev/ttyS0

       Serve  on  port  8080  as  a daemon (do not exit after first connection), translate
       characters using the slovene.ini translation file, limit any incoming text to maxi-
       mum  100  characters and print received data to the terminal.  Note that text limit
       works only when running as a server.

              copris -p 8080 -d -t slovene.ini -l 100

       Read local file Manual.md using the specified printer  feature  set  epson.ini  and
       output formatted text to a USB interface on the local computer:

              copris -r epson.ini /dev/ttyUSB0 < Manual.md
