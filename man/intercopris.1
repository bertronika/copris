.SH NAME
\f[B]intercopris\f[R] \- an interactive command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]intercopris\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R]] [\f[I]printer device\f[R] or
\f[I]output file\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Intercopris is a tool that provides a readline\-based command line
interpreter with the same parsing mechanism as in COPRIS\[cq] printer
feature files and custom variables.
.PP
It is intended to be used for experimenting with printers by providing a
straight\-forward interface between human\-readable numbers and raw
data, understood by printers.
.PP
Intercopris gives you a command prompt, similar to that of a shell.
It understands three different types of data:
.IP \[bu] 2
numerical values in hexadecimal (0x\f[I]NN\f[R]), decimal (\f[I]NN\f[R])
or octal (0\f[I]NN\f[R]) notation, separated with whitespace
.IP \[bu] 2
plain text, prefixed with `\f[B]t\f[R]'
.IP \[bu] 2
various built\-in commands (e.g.\ \f[CR]dump\f[R], \f[CR]hex\f[R],
\f[CR]last\f[R] etc.), listed when starting the program
.PP
After completing a line and pressing return, Intercopris will parse the
entered data.
If it is a built\-in command, it will toggle its internal state or echo
out any possible result.
If commands are entered, Copris will process them using the supplied
printer feature file (which must be specified with \f[CR]\-f FILE\f[R])
and send them to the output.
.PP
Intercopris supports saving and reloading command history.
To use it, you must create a file whose filename is told to you by the
output of \f[CR]intercopris \-h\f[R].
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]\-f\f[R] \f[I]FILE\f[R]
Read commands from printer feature \f[I]FILE\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-h\f[R]
Show a short option summary and expected location of the history file.
.TP
\f[B]\-n\f[R]
Do not use the history file.
.PP
Last argument should be the output character device or file path.
If omitted, text will be echoed to the terminal.
.SH DEVELOPMENT
Intercopris is a part of COPRIS, a converting printer server.
.PP
Its development repository resides at \c
